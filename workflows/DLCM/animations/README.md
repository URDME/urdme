* **delta_notch_continuous.gif** Figure 3.2 in [1]. Older version of
this experiment was presented in [4].
* **delta_notch_discrete.gif** Figure 3.2 in [1].
* **tumor1-2.gif** Figure 3.3 in [1]. Older versions of
these experiments were presented in [3,4].
* **chemotaxis1--4.gif** Figure 3.4 in [1]. Older versions of
the fourth experiment was presented in [4].
* **chemotaxis3D.gif** Figure 3.5 in [1].
