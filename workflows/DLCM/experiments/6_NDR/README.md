Advanced Delta-notch signalling modeling in a growing population of
cells. This example is used as the running model in [1]. The model
itself is described in [2]

There are a few (very mild) dependencies on functions from STENGLIB,
download freely from www.stenglib.org. PDE Toolbox is used to assemble
the Laplacian operator over a Delaunay triangulation.
