### Sample models:

* 1_basic_test/
	Basic test of relaxation of a population of cells.

* 2_avascular_tumour/
	Avascular tumour model, results in §3.3 in [1].
  * old_examples/
  Earlier models from [2,3].

* 3_gradient_growth/
	Chemotaxis models (2D/3D), results in §3.4 in [1].

* 4_delta_notch/
	Delta-notch signalling in a growing population of cells.
	Results in §3.2 in [1].

* 6_NDR/
	Advanced Delta-notch signalling modeling in a growing population
	of cells. This example is used as the running model in [4]. Note:
	this is an earlier example not using the dlcm-solver
	directly. Refer to the README-file within this directory.

* 9_cell_sorting/
  Cell sorting experiments. Results in §3.1 in [1].
